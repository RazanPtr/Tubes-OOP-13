CLI INTERFACE:

How to Compile : Open terminal go to directory Tubes-OOP-13 then use command Code/compile.sh

How To Run : Open terminal go to directory Tubes-OOP-13 then use command Code/run.sh

GUI INTERFACE:
We created a trial GUI that simply consists of a loading screen, a main menu, help menu, exit button,
can accept argument of Sim name and Sim location and display the location of the house on the World grid.
The GUI is seperate from our CLI-interfaced program and is created as a means for us to explore Java GUI
for the very first time. Though it is very much incomplete and could be further worked on, since this is our
very first time working with GUI, we hope this extra effort shows you how dedicated we are in completing our task ^^
